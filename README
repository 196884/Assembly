Simple assembly sources to learn about assembly programming.

Tested on MacOSX (see the Makefile)

The code can be debugged via LLDB to get a better understanding.

LLDB cheat sheet:

lldb <executable>
# To set a breakpoint at the very start:
(lldb) breakpoint set --name main

# To launch the program:
(lldb) run

# To step:
(lldb) step
or
(lldb) s
(then pressing enter will continue stepping)

# To display the contents of the registers
(lldb) register read

# To inspect memory at a given address:
(lldb) memory read 0x...
to check what options are available:
(lldb) help memory read
in particular:
(lldb) memory read 0x... -c <nb of bytes to show> -l <nb of bytes per line>
the address can also be expressed relative to a pointer content:
(lldb) memory read $rsp
or with an offset:
(lldb) memory read $rsp+0x8
